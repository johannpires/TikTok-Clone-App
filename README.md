# TikTok Clone App

## Overview
This is a native iOS TikTok app clone fully developed in Swift using SwiftUI framework.

## Purpose
This application aims to replicate the popular TikTok experience on iOS devices using the SwiftUI framework. With a user-friendly interface TikTok has a focus on creating and sharing short-form videos. This TikTok clone, as the original version, provides a seamless and entertaining platform for users to showcase their creativity.

The primary goal of this project was to enhance my SwiftUI skills. At the same time, sharing it here makes it an excellent resource for developers looking to advance their proficiency with Apple's modern UI framework.

This app therefore, offers a comprehensive example of building a native iOS app using SwiftUI to mimic the design and all the main functionalities of the TikTok app.
